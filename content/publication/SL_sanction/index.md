abstract: "Do citizens sanction undemocratic traditional leaders, and how? Are these sanctions associated with institutional quality and public good provision? Our study employed a survey experiment involving 900 individuals from 79 villages in Sierra Leone. Our research highlights the repertoire of political actions available to community members to punish their village leaders. We found that community members are most inclined to use indirect sanctions, primarily by lodging complaints with higher authorities, to punish their town chiefs. They also employ direct sanctions, such as public blame and economic measures, though to a lesser extent. Furthermore, our research highlights the influential role of town chief councilors in shaping these sanctioning preferences. Lastly, we explore how differences in sanctioning preferences at the village level relate to institutional quality and public goods provision. In summary, this study contributes to the literature on traditional political institutions by addressing a critical but previously understudied aspect: the strength of non-electoral sanctioning preferences."
