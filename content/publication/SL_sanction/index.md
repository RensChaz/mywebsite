abstract: "Do citizens sanction local leaders who are not selected through regular elections, and how? This study explores non-electoral accountability mechanisms for local leaders. We propose a theoretical framework distinguishing between direct and indirect sanctioning channels, and assess the extent to which citizens view these sanctions as legitimate. Through a survey experiment in Sierra Leone, we find that citizens generally prefer indirect sanctions, which are perceived as less costly. Interestingly, most citizens do not view direct sanctions as legitimate. We also show the involvement of political intermediaries increases the perceived legitimacy of sanctions among community members. Furthermore, indirect sanctions correlate with more inclusive decision-making and lower conflict levels. This research suggests that accountability mechanisms operate in diverse ways depending on the institutional context people encounter and underscores its importance in ensuring responsiveness from local leaders."
