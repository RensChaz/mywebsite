I am a political scientist studying how institutions, social norms, and economic interests shape political accountability. My research examines why leaders respond to certain groups rather than others, and how these dynamics influence the provision of public goods.

I focus on two interrelated agendas. First, I analyze environmental politics as a window into broader patterns of accountability, including deforestation and drought-relief policies. Second, I investigate how citizens and intermediaries shape support for climate policies and pro-environmental behavior.

Methodologically, I employ a combination of field experiments, quasi-experiments, and coordinated multi-site designs to uncover causal mechanisms. I also engage in applied work, evaluating interventions aimed at promoting sustainable behavior and broadening pro-climate coalitions.
