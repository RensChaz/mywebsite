I am a Ph.D. candidate at the European University Institute in comparative politics supervised by Miriam Golden (EUI) and Maarten Voors (WUR). My research focus on accountability relationships in chieftaincy systems in Sierra Leone, and the politics of land and forest in Sierra Leone and Cameroon. 

I am currently developing a research project about the institutional arrangements enabling the degrowth of "brown sectors" (meet industry, fossil fuels, ski...) and their interrelated political risks.
