I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the European University Institute, specializing in comparative politics under the guidance of Professors Miriam Golden (EUI) and Maarten Voors (WUR). My research primarily revolves around examining accountability dynamics within chieftaincy systems in Sierra Leone, as well as delving into the intricate politics surrounding land and forest management in Sierra Leone and Cameroon. 

In addition to my doctoral dissertation, I am actively developing a broader research agenda centered on comprehending the institutional factors that facilitate the ecological and just transition. More specifically, my keen interest lies in investigating how ecological deliberative spaces influence political behaviors and preferences. Furthermore, I am channeling my efforts towards exploring institutional frameworks that support the degrowth of "brown sectors" (such as the meat industry, fossil fuels, and skiing), along with their interconnected political challenges.
