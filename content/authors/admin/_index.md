I am a researcher with a deep interest in understanding the politics of transitioning economies.

My work focuses on two main research agendas. First, I seek to better understand the institutional factors that facilitate an ecological and just transition. Specifically, I explore the mechanisms that shape support for fair yet costly climate policies. Second, I analyze the politics of drought responses in France.

To address these questions, I use a variety of methodological tools, including broadly defined experiments and quasi-experimental methods.
