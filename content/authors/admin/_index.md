I am a researcher with a deep interest in understanding the politics of transitioning economies. 

I developed three main research agendas. First, I engage in a deeper empirical and theoretical examination of accountability dynamics within chieftaincy systems in Western Africa and the intricate politics surrounding land and forest management. Second, I aim to get a better picture of the institutional factors that facilitate the ecological and just transition. I am more specifically interested in understanding the mechanisms shaping the support for just and costly climate policies. Third, I am assessing the politics of drought responses in France.

To answers those questions I used a variety of methodological tools ranging from experiments broadly defined and quasi-experimental methods.
