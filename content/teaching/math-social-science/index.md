## Overview and objectives

The objective of this 10-hour workshop is to provide a refresher into basic algebra and calculus. Knowledge of algebra and calculus is increasingly crucial in quantitatively-oriented political and social science and allows researchers to better understand, manipulate and develop statistical methods as well as formal theory. This knowledge will also help researchers to better follow quantitative methods courses. Next to providing a refresher into basic algebra and calculus, the workshop discusses examples of their use in political and social science practice.

The workshop will be divided into 4+1 blocks, one for each of the five workshop days. The first block will refresh basic mathematical notions related to arithmetic, notation, and calculus. The second block aims to familiarize students with common equations present in actual social science research and introduce derivatives and extrema. The third block introduces students to basic notions of probability and random variables and most common probability distributions. The fourth block focuses on vectors and matrices, their basic properties, and their utility in social science research. Finally, the last block sums up the previous blocks and adapts to studentsâ€™ questions/concerns.

Every day, students are required to do short proposed exercises in the last 15 minutes of the class. On the next day, one selected student will solve the exercises. The aim is not to take time apart from the 10-hour workshop. The workshop has two main objectives: first, to familiarize students with basic notions of arithmetics, calculus, probability, and algebra; and second, to help students self-evaluate themselves and be aware of accessible materials that can help them improve their background mathematical knowledge.
